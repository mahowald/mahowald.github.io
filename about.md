<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

Hi! My name is Matthew Mahowald.

I'm a mathematician and programmer working in machine learning (or, as the cool kids at Gartner call it, "Artificial Intelligence").

These days, I'm chief scientist at a stealth fintech startup.
I was formerly Data Science Group Lead at [Crowe LLP](https://www.crowe.com/), and, before that, Director of Data Science at Open Data Group (since renamed to [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com/)).
In a previous life, I studied [aspects of the geometry of string physics](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/232) that were [mostly uninteresting to the rest of the research community](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5986335289667352222&as_sdt=400005&sciodt=0,14&hl=en).
