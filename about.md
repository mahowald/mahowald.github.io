<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

Hi! My name is Matthew Mahowald.

I'm a mathematician and programmer working in machine learning (or, as the cool kids at Gartner call it, "Artificial Intelligence").

These days, I lead the machine learning team at [K1X](https://k1x.io/), a fintech startup in the alternative investment services space.
My interests and activities are focused primarily on forecasting (particularly Bayesian time series analysis), and applications of deep learning (such as reinforcement learning and natural language understanding) to problems in finance.
Prior to my current role, I spent several years working in machine learning and quantitative trading at PureTech Capital Management and (briefly) [Akuna Capital](https://akunacapital.com/).
I've also formerly been Data Science Group Lead at [Crowe LLP](https://www.crowe.com/), and Director of Data Science at Open Data Group (since renamed to [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com/)).

Long ago, in the mists of the primordial world, I studied [aspects of the geometry of string physics](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/232) that were [mostly uninteresting to the rest of the research community](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5986335289667352222&as_sdt=400005&sciodt=0,14&hl=en).
My research area was geometry and mathematical physics, particularly mathematical aspects of string theory such as Gromov-Witten theory, mirror symmetry, and enumerative geometry, as well as gauge theory.
Recent experiments have largely failed to find evidence of supersymmetry, so as a physical theory strings appear dead in the water... but at least the math is still interesting!
