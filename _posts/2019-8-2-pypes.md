Pipes are a mainstay of inter-process communication in Unix,
and pipelines are also a hugely powerful feature in functional
programming languages. They also map well to data science and
machine learning applications: Many models can be thought of
as chains of transformations applied to inputs. Defining
models as pipelines of functionlike objects reflects this view,
and encourages good habits from functional programming (functions
without side effects, modular and testable code, avoiding mutation, etc).
It turns out that adding pipelines to Python is pretty straightforward,
and also provides a mechanism to include some "leaky" type checking along
the way.

First, let's look at what we want a pipeline to look like. As a very
simple example, consider two functions that we want to compose:

```python
def f(x: str) -> int:
    return len(x)

def g(x: int) -> int:
    return x + 5
```

Notice the type hints (a feature introduced in Python 3). 
We want to define an easy way to do composition of these two
functions, as well as raise an error if they have incompatible type
signatures---something like:

```python
pipe = f | g
pipe("abc") # returns 8
```

I've chosen a "|" operator to represent composition by analogy
with unix, and in this pipeline data flows from left to right. 

The easiest way to add a pipe operator is to define a class
to wrap our function objects. Class instances are callable (through
the `__call__` special method), and we can define our own operators
in them as well. Let's define a `Pipe` class:

```python
class Pipe(object):
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def __or__(self, x):
        if not callable(x):
            raise TypeError("target must be callable")
        
        if self.func is None:
            return Pipe(func=x)
        
        def compose(*args, **kwargs):
            return x(self.func(*args, **kwargs))
        
        return Pipe(func=compose)
```

Recall that the `__or__` special method defines the bitwise-OR operator (`|`),
so this function is where the magic happens. We can now do something like
the following:

```python
pipe = Pipe(f) | g
```

(and we can generate pipelines of functions on the fly as needed.)

This is a good start, but there's a little more to be done: we're not
taking advantage of the type hints functionality to verify the integrity of our
pipeline, and having to wrap the first function in a `Pipe` object is
still a little clunky. 

Let's define a utility function to retrieve a callable object's signature:

```python
import typing

def _get_signature(funclike):
    if isinstance(funclike, Pipe):
        return funclike.signature
    if hasattr(funclike, "signature"):
        return funclike.signature
    if hasattr(funclike, "__call__"):
        sig = typing.get_type_hints(funclike.__call__)
        if len(sig) != 0:
            return sig
    return typing.get_type_hints(funclike)
```

There's a few things going on in this function. First, I've
added an additional attribute to our `Pipe` class called
`signature`. This is where we'll store the signature of
the functions we wrap (since our `Pipe` class is generic, we
can't a priori define good type hints for its `__call__` method).
We're also allowing for the possibility that some other callable
object defines a `signature` field, and if the object defines
a `__call__` method with non-empty type hints, we grab the
type hints from there. If none of those conditions are satisfied,
we fall back on grabbing the type hints from the object itself.
In action, this function will produce a dictionary defining the
signature, like so:

```python
def f(x: int) -> str:
    return "{}".format(x)

_get_signature(f) # returns {"x": int, "return": str}
```

Checking that two signatures are at least theoretically
composable is also straightforward:

```python
def __check_composition(sig1, sig2):
    for k, v in sig2.items():
        if k == "return":
            continue
        if v == sig1["return"]:
            return True
    return False
```

This composition-compatability checking is leaky in that
it only checks that at least one input to the downstream function
matches the return type of the upstream function. Thus,
it's possible to "fool" this composition check if the downstream
function isn't unary. (And, of course, type hints are not really
the same as type signatures---so a careless programmer could
always put incorrect type hints!)

Here's our new version of the `Pipe` class, with signatures
and some additional error handling:

```python
class Pipe(object):
    def __init__(self, func=None, signature=None):
        if func is not None and not callable(func):
            raise TypeError("func argument must be callable")
        
        self.func = func
        self.signature = signature
        if signature is None and self.func is not None:
            self.signature = _get_signature(self.func)

    
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.func is None:
            return
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def __or__(self, x):
        if not callable(x):
            raise TypeError("target must be callable")
        
        if self.func is None:
            return Pipe(func=x)
        
        sig1 = self.signature
        sig2 = _get_signature(x)

        if not _check_composition(sig1, sig2):
            raise ValueError("Incompatible signatures: {}, {}".format(sig1, sig2))
        
        def compose(*args, **kwargs):
            return x(self.func(*args, **kwargs))

        newsig = self.signature.copy()
        newsig["return"] = sig2["return"]
        
        return Pipe(func=compose, signature=newsig)
```

For extra credit, we can also define a special `Pipe` subclass to indicate the
start of the pipeline. Let's call it `Input`:

```python
class Input(Pipe):
    def __init__(self, signature):
        self.signature = {"input": signature, "return": signature}
        self.func = lambda x: x
```

One reason I like doing this is that it makes the pipeline definition a little
bit more self-documenting. Here's a full example:

```python
def f(x: str) -> int:
    return len(x)

def g(x: int) -> int:
    return x + 5

def adder(x):
    def h(y: int) -> int:
        return x + y
    return h

class Caller(object):
    def __init__(self, key: str):
        self.key = key
    def __call__(self, x: int) -> dict:
        return {key: x}

pipeline = ( Input(str)
           | f
           | adder(-4)
           | g
           | Caller("hello!")
           )

pipeline("abc") # returns {"hello!": 4}
```

Many of the examples in Python lean heavily into object-oriented programming,
but I hope this post shows that Python can actually be very functional if
you want it to be!

One additional advantage of defining pipelines in this way is that,
although our implementation of the `Pipe` object is quite rudimentary,
we've really separated the definition of the pipeline from its execution.
It's easy to imagine leveraging some more advanced tools (e.g. Dask or
the new-ish `futures` module) to make each component in a pipeline execute
concurrently and asynchronously (and perhaps even distributed).
